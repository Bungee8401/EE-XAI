# 0 airplane
    100 epoch works
    500 * exit_loss  +  200 * cls_loss   + 500* sim_loss

# 3 cat (not perfect, often misclassified as dog
    300 epoch
    cls_loss switch to MSE(output_logits, label)
    500 * exit_loss  +  1000 * cls_loss   + 500* sim_loss

# 5 dog
    300 epoch
    cls_loss switch to MSE(output_logits, label)
    500 * exit_loss  +  1000 * cls_loss   + 500* sim_loss

# 4 deer (not at all, wonder why
    500 epoch
    MSE cls_loss
    500 * exit_loss  +  1000 * cls_loss   + 500* sim_loss


# 7 horse
    300 epoch
    cls_loss switch to MSE(output_logits, label)
    500 * exit_loss  +  1000 * cls_loss   + 500* sim_loss

# 9 truck (not at all
    200 epoch
    two cls_loss
    exit_loss  +  500 * cls_loss2 +  500 * cls_loss1 + 500 * sim_loss

    maybe, we dont have to always let them early exit. even if the gen_imgs exit later, can also be used as examples
    to analyze! just negative examples against the original imgs



--------------------complexity test of generator and classifier------------------------

# 9 truck
    weights         loaded
    exit            disable E1, E2;
                    E3 can be classified perfectly
                    -> generator? more like classifier not enough to tell

# 3 cat
    weights         train 200 epochs
                    a) exit_loss + ... -> maintain the same exit location, pics looking as original, no weird looking patterns
                    b) 200 * exit_loss + ... -> E1 works perfectly, but pics have the same weird patterns at corner, might be
                    c) 100 * exit_loss + ... -> E1 works, corner weird patterns, improve a bit at the early exit
                    d) 150 * exit_loss + ... -> a good compromise

                    change exit_loss to .mean(all exits); rest the same
                    a) 200 * exit_loss -> maintain original while correcting wrong, mild on EE position change;
                    b) 250 * exit_loss -> maintain original while correcting wrong, 3/4 maintain or EE, 1/4 exit late
                    c) 500 * exit_loss -> all E0 and correct. but with severe edge pattern


# 0 airplane
    weights         train 200 epochs
                    a) 250 * exit_loss  -> mostly maintain

                    train 100 epochs
                    b) 500 * exit_loss  -> all E0
